# ðŸ’¡ Energy System

Once you have acquired the NFT footballMOVE, you will get daily energy which will determine the maximum time available for which you can workout and earn. Once your energy is depleted, you will not be able to earn anything although you can continue.

In the beta phase of the app, you will initially receive 90 energy points daily, which is basically the equivalent of 90 minutes of training, like a soccer game (1 energy = 90 minutes). The energy will be given to you in 2 intervals, 45 energy points for each $FMOVE token you have every 8 hours.

If the investor decides to buy and continue the practices and gains, he can buy energy at the price of 10 $FMOVE for 90 energies, an addendum that is allowed only one buyback per day for each $FMOVE that the investor owns

**Case Study**

1. If you have 1 NFT footballMove, you will have 90 energy/day and 45 energy every 2 8-hour intervals and a maximum of 1 energy purchase per day.
2. If you have 3 NFT's footballMOVE, you will have 180 energies/day, 135 energies for each 6 intervals in 8 hours and a maximum of 3 energy buybacks per day
