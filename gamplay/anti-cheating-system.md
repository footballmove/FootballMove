# ðŸ›¡ Anti-Cheating System

In order to bring security to our investors, we have developed 3 ways to anti-cheat during the game, where anyone who tries to cheat will be severely penalized.

We will use the following means to deter these potential cheaters:

* [x] GPS tracking.
* [x] Sensing health and movement data.
* [x] Explanation of the machinery in order to detect cheating through data simulations.

Any violation of the device's root code will result in a blockage of FootballMove, in which there will be a discrepancy in your functioning.

Transferring a NFT's footballmove from one account to another will cause the NFT's footballmove to enter a freeze period, during which time users will not be able to use their NFT's footballmove.\
\
If energy is lost during the process of transferring the NFT's footballmove from the inventory to the wallet, all unopened mystery boxes from the NFT's footballmove account will be burned.

Note that wasting power listing a NFT's footballmove on the market will not burn out the mystery boxes.
