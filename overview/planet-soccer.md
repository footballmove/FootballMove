# üåè Planet Soccer

The rise in popularity of the World Cup from 1930 to the 2002 event. The data varies from 434,500 people in the initial event, reaching, in 2002, 2.5 billion spectators. It must be remembered that in 1930 there was no television and many limitations in the media, a fact unimaginable today. This worldwide visibility that the World Cup has makes it a major commercial event. This means that FIFA has built a billion-dollar business selling its brand and television rights by offering global companies the biggest advertising opportunity in the world.

Another important thing to think about is that the World Cup is not only about soccer: economics and politics are also part of the package! The choice of the host country for the event is made by agreement between investors and governmental institutions based on common political and economic interests. In addition, the stress of staging the event is so great that FIFA has resorted to financial hedges against possible World Cup cancellations. One example that became quite famous was the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, where FIFA insured against cancellations due to earthquakes or political instability.
