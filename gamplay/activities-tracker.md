# ‚úè Activities Tracker

To track your workout activity, we have developed our in-app tracker where the user has to manually start and end the activity. We will use GPS, motion sensor, gyroscope and heart rate (BPM) to accurately track your activity data In the beta version of the app, we will only allow 3 activities - Walking, Running (cycling is in development). And these actions should be done outdoors for better GPS connection purposes. After training, we will show the data about:

* [x] Heart Rate (BPM)
* [x] Distance
* [x] Speed
* [x] Time
* [x] Earnings
